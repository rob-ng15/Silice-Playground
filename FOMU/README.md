# Silice-Playground
My Silice (https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice) Coding Experimental Area

Examples to play with FOMU via Silice. _I only have a **HACKER** FOMU, so in my examples, the pcf file used is always `fomu-hacker.pcf`. This will need to be changed in `fomu_hacker_USB_SPRAM.sh` for your model of FOMU. 

BLINKY pulses the LED, 
USB_ACM echoes UART input and sets LED according to the input
