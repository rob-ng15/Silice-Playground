# Silice-Playground
My Silice (https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice) Coding Experimental Area

Examples to play with FOMU via Silice. _I only have a **HACKER** FOMU, so in my examples, the pcf file used is always `fomu-hacker.pcf`. This will need to be changed in `fomu_hacker_USB_SPRAM.sh` for your model of FOMU.

USB_ACM echoes UART input and sets LED according to the input

## j1eforth for FOMU

Translation of the j1eforth interactive Forth environment for FOMU (https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu with documentation at  https://workshop.fomu.im/en/latest/).

The original J1 CPU (https://www.excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html with a very clear explanatory paper at https://www.excamera.com/files/j1.pdf) along with the j1eforth interactive Forth environment (https://github.com/samawati/j1eforth) was written for an FPGA with access to 16384 x 16bit (256kbit) dual port single cycle block ram, whereas the FOMU has 120kbit of block ram. It does however have 1024kbit of single port ram (65536 x 16bit), which is more than sufficient for j1eforth, but it has 2 cycle latency.

j1eforth with the enhanced J1+ CPU for FOMU is coded in Silice (https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice) due to my limited (i.e. NO) FPGA programming experience. Silice provides a nice introduction to FPGA programming for those coming from more tradition software coding. The main challenge for the FOMU is that there is latency to the single port ram, requiring a main loop with cycles to guide memory accesses.

I've, in my opinion, tidied up the code, to make the variables more explanatory, and to aid my coding.

For communicating via a terminal the tinyfpga_bx_usbserial (https://github.com/stef/nb-fomu-hw) was implemented to provide a 115200 baud UART. A 512 character input and output buffer was added, allowing copy and paste of code into the terminal.

## Using j1eforth on the FOMU

Download the source code from this repository. Ensure that you have the required toolchain installed. Compile (on Linux) with `./fomu_hacker_USB_SPRAM.sh j1eforth.ice` within the source directory.

Or download the precompiled `j1eforth-FOMU-HACKER.dfu` file from this repository.

Upload the compiled bitstream to your FOMU with `dfu-util -D build.dfu`, or the downloaded bitstream with `dfu-util -D j1eforth-FOMU-HACKER.dfu` and connect via your chosen terminal, for minicom `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0` (ACM0 may need replacing with an appropriate number on your machine).

## Resources on the FOMU

Resource usage has been considerably reduced from my initial attempt at Silice coding, with considerable assistance from @sylefeb who has assisted in using blockrams for the dstack and rstack, and dual ported blockrams for the uart input and output FIFO buffers:

## J1 and J1+ CPU Differences

The original J1 CPU had a 33 entry data stack and a 32 entry return stack. The J1+ CPU has a 257 entry data stack and a 256 entry return stack.

The original J1 CPU has this instruction encoding:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| F | E | D | C | B | A | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 |                    LITERAL VALUE                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | 0 | 0 |            BRANCH TARGET ADDRESS                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | 0 | 1 |            CONDITIONAL BRANCH TARGET ADDRESS      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | 1 | 0 |            CALL TARGET ADDRESS                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | 1 | 1 |R2P| ALU OPERATION |T2N|T2R|N2A|   | RSTACK| DSTACK|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| F | E | D | C | B | A | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

T   : Top of data stack
N   : Next on data stack
PC  : Program Counter
 
LITERAL VALUES : push a value onto the data stack
CONDITIONAL    : BRANCHS pop and test the T
CALLS          : PC+1 onto the return stack

T2N : Move T to N
T2R : Move T to top of return stack
N2A : STORE T to memory location addressed by N
R2P : Move top of return stack to PC

RSTACK and DSTACK are signed values (twos compliment) that are
the stack delta (the amount to increment or decrement the stack
by for their respective stacks: return and data)
```

The J1+ CPU adds up to 16 new alu operations, by assigning new alu operations by using ALU bit 4 to determine if J1 or J1+ alu operations, with the ALU instruction encoding:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 | 1 | 1 |R2P| ALU OPERATION |T2N|T2R|N2A|J1+| RSTACK| DSTACK|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| F | E | D | C | B | A | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Binary ALU Operation Code | J1 CPU | J1+ CPU | J1 CPU Forth Word (notes) | J1+ CPU Forth Word | J1+ Implemented in j1eforth
:----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
0000 | T | T==0 | (top of stack) | 0= | X
0001 | N | T<>0 | (next on stack) | 0<> | X
0010 | T+N | N<>T | + | <> | X
0011 | T&N | T+1 | and | 1+ | X
0100 | T&#124;N | T<<1 | or | 2&#42; | X
0101 | T^N | T>>1 | xor | 2/ | (stops ROM working)
0110 | ~T | N>T | invert | > <br> (signed) | X
0111 | N==T | NU>T | = | > <br> (unsigned) | X
1000 | N<T | T<0 | < <br> (signed) | 0< | X
1001 | N>>T | T>0 | rshift | 0> | X
1010 | T-1 | ABST | 1- | abs | X
1011 |  rt | MXNT | (push top of return stack to data stack) | max | X
1100 | [T] | MNNT | @ <br> (read from memory) | min | X

1110 | dsp | N-T | (depth of stacks) | - | (stops ROM working)
1111 | NU<T | N>=T | < <br> (unsigned) | >= <br> (signed) | X

*I am presently unable to add the 2/ or - to the j1eforth ROM, as the compiled ROM is no longer functional. Some assistance to add these instructions would be appreciated.*

### Memory Map

Hexadecimal Address | Usage
:----: | :----:
0000 - 7fff | Program code and data
f000 | UART input/output (best to leave to j1eforth to operate via IN/OUT buffers).
f001 | UART Status (bit 1 = TX buffer full, bit 0 = RX character available, best to leave to j1eforth to operate via IN/OUT buffers).
f002 | RGB LED input/output bitfield { 13b0, red, green, blue } `rgbled led!` sets the RGB LED, `led@` places the RGB LED status onto the stack.
f003 | BUTTONS input bitfield { 12b0, button 4, button 3, button 2, button 1 }, `buttons@` places the buttons status onto the stack.
f004 | TIMER 1hz (1 second) counter since boot, `timer@` places the timer onto the stack

### INIT stages

Due to the size of the block ram on the FOMU (120kbit or 7680 x 16bit) and the J1+ CPU requiring 256kbit (16384 x 16bit) of RAM, the J1+ CPU on the FOMU copies the j1eforth code from an initialised block ram to SPRAM, and uses the SPRAM for the J1+ CPU.

INIT | Action
:-----: | :-----:
0 | 0 the SPRAM. <br> <br> Due to the latency, this is controlled by CYCLE (pipeline).
1 | COPY the j1eforth ROM to SPRAM. <br> <br> Due to latency, this is controoled by CYCLE (pipeline).
2 | SPARE (not used in the J1+ CPU).
3 | Start the J1+ CPU at pc==0 from SPRAM.

### Pipeline / CYCLE logic

Due to blockram and SPRAM latency, there needs to be a pipeline for the J1+ CPU on the FOMU, which is set to 0 to 12 stages. These are used as follows:

CYCLE | Action
:-----: | :-----:
ALL <br> (at entry to INIT==3 loop) | Check for input from the UART, put into buffer. <br> Check if output in the UART buffer and send to UART. <br> __NOTE:__ To stop a race condition, uartOutBufferTop = newuartOutBufferTop is updated after output.
0 | blockram: Read data stackNext and rstackTop, started in CYCLE==9. <br> <br> SPRAM: Start the read of memory position [stackTop] by setting the SPRAM sram_address and sram_readwrite flag. <br> This is done speculatively in case the ALU needs this memory later in the pipeline.
3 | Complete read of memory position [stackTop] from SPRAM by reading sram_data_read.
4 | Start read of the instruction at memory position [pc] by setting sram_address and sram_readwrite flag.
7 | Complete read of the instruction at memory position [pc] by reading sram_data_read. <br> <br> *The instruction is decoded automatically by the continuos assigns := block at the top of the code.*
8 | Instruction Execution <br> <br> Determine if LITERAL, BRANCH, BRANCH, CALL or ALU. <br> <br> In the ALU (J1 CPU block) the UART input buffer, UART status register, RGB LED status, input buttons or memory is selected as appropriate. The UART buffers and the speculative memory read of [stackTop] are used to allow __ALL__ ALU operations to execute in one cycle.<br> <br> At the end of the ALU if a write to memory is required, this is initiated by setting the sram_address, sram_data_write and sram_readwrite flag. This will be completed by CYCLE==12. <br> <br> Output to UART output buffer or the RGB LED is performed here if a write to an I/O address, not memory, is requested.
9 | Start the writing to the block ram for the data and return stacks. This will be completed by CYCLE==10.
10 | Update all of the J1+ CPU pointers for the data and return stacks, the program counter, and stackTop. <br> <br> Start the reading of the data and return stacks. This will be completed by CYCLE==11, but not actually read until the return to CYCLE==0.
12 | Reset the sram_readwrite flag, to complete any memory write started in CYCLE==8 in the ALU.
ALL <br> (at end of INIT==3 loop) | Reset the UART output if any character was transmitted. <br> <br> Move to the next CYCLE.

### Forth Words to try

__j1eforth__ defaults to __hex__ for numbers. 

* `.` prints the top of the stack in the current base, `.#` does the same in decimal.
* `u.` prints the _unsigned_ top of the stack in the current base, `u.#` does the same in decimal.
* `.r` prints the second in the stack, aligned to top of stack digits, in the current base, `.r#` does the same in decimal.
* `u.r` prints the _unsigned_ second in the stack, aligned to top of stack digits, in the current base, `u.r#` does the same in decimal.

* `cold` reset
* `words` list known Forth words
* `cr` output a carriage return
* `2a emit` output a * ( character 2a (hex) 42 (decimal) )
* `decimal` use decimal notation
* `hex` use hexadecimal notation

The j1eforth wordlist has been extended to include some double (32 bit) integer words, including `2variable` to create a double variable, double integer arithmetic, along with some words for manipulating double integers on the stack.

* `2variable` creates a named double integer variable
* `2!` writes the double integer on the stack to a double integer variable (this was already part of j1eforth)
* `2@` reads a double integer variable to the stack (this was already part of j1eforth)
* `s>d` converts a single integer on the stack to a double integer on the stack
* `d1+` and `d1-` increment and decrement the double integer on the stack
* `d2*` and `d2/` double and halve the double integer on the stack
* `d+` and `d-` do double integer addition and subtraction
* `d=`, `d<>`, `d<`, `d>` do double integer comparisons
* `d0=`, `d0<>` and `d0<` do double integer 0 comparisons
* `dand`, `dor`, `dxor` and `dinvert` do double integer binary arithmetic
* `2swap` `2over`, `2rot` and `2nip` along with the j1eforth `2dup` and `2drop` work with double integers on the stack
* `m*` and `um*` perform single integer signed and unsigned multiplication giving a double integer result (these were already part of j1eforth)
* `m/mod` and `um/mod` divide a double integer by a single integer, signed and unsigned, to give a single integer remainder and quotient (these were already part of j1eforth)

### Sample Code

This can be copied and pasted into the terminal. Try to keep line lengths relatively short when cutting and pasting.

```
: vtcs 1b emit 5b emit 32 emit 4a emit ;
: vtxy 1b emit 5b emit 0 u.r# 3b emit 0 u.r# 48 emit ;
: ledtest
    ( store the base, set to binary )
    base @ 2 base !
    100 0 do 
        ( clear the screen )
        vtcs
        ( move to 8 1, output 5 digit timer )
        8 1 vtxy timer@ dup 5 u.r# space ." seconds "
        led! led@ 
        ( output 3 digit binary )
        8 u.r space ." LEDs" 
        8000 0 do loop 
    loop
    cr 0 led! base ! ;
```

This code defines 3 new Forth words:

* `vtcs` which clears the terminal ( sends ESC [ 2 J )
* `vtxy` moves the cursor to the position defined by the top two locations on the stack, `8 1 vtxy` moves the cursor to line 1 column 8 ( sends ESC [ 1 ; 8 H )
* `ledtest` Loops, clears the screen then displays the number of seconds elapsed whilst changing the RGB LED to the lower 3 bits of the timers, and then displaying the binary (`2 base !` changes to binary) status of the RGB LED. Finally turning off the RGB LED.

Start the test with `ledtest`.
